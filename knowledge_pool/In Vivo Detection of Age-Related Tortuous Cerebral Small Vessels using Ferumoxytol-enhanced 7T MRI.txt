Histopathological studies suggest that cerebral small vessel tortuosity is crucial in age-related blood flow reduction and cellular degeneration. However, in vivo evidence is lacking. Here, we used Ferumoxytol-enhanced 7T MRI to directly visualize cerebral small vessels (<300 µm), enabling the identification of vascular tortuosity and exploration of its links to age, tissue atrophy, and vascular risk factors. High-resolution 2D/3D gradient echo MRI at 7T enhanced with Ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO), was obtained and analyzed for cerebral small medullary artery tortuosity from 37 healthy participants (21-70 years; mean/SD: 38±14 years; 19 females). Tortuous artery count and tortuosity indices were compared between young and old groups. Age effects on vascular tortuosity were examined through partial correlations and multiple linear regression, adjusting for sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and other vascular risk factors. Associations between tortuous medullary arteries and tissue atrophy, perivascular spaces (PVS), and white matter (WM) hyperintensities were explored. Age and BMI, rather than BP, showed positive correlations with both tortuous artery count and tortuosity indices. A significant correlation existed between the number of tortuous arteries and WM atrophy. WM lesions were found in proximity to or at the distal ends of tortuous medullary arteries, especially within the deep WM. Moreover, the elderly population displayed a higher prevalence of PVS, including those containing enclosed tortuous arteries. Leveraging the blooming effect of Ferumoxytol, 7T MRI excels in directly detecting cerebral small arterial tortuosity in vivo, unveiling its associations with age, BMI, tissue atrophy, WMH and PVS.
