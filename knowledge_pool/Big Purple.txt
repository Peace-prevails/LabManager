A variety of novel technologies, including Intel Skylake processors, NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs, NVLINK, NVMe SSD, GPUDirect RDMA, Adaptive Routing and in-network memory/computing are implemented in this new supercomputer designed to advance such diverse computational workflows as machine learning, image analysis, predictive health analytics, bioinformatics and massively parallel bio-molecular simulations.

BigPurple Computational Node Specifications
Below is a detailed list of the computational resources available to you on the Next Generation High Performance Computer, BigPurple, at NYU Langone Health.

Login Nodes
Four load balanced Login nodes are available to facilitate the access to the cluster in a High Availability fashion that ensures the resources are readily available and under subscribed. The Login nodes can be accessed directly, where you can submit jobs to the Job Scheduler. Click here for directions on accessing the login nodes. Applications should never run directly on the login nodes, they must always be submitted through the job scheduler.
