Our lab is CAI2R. CAI2R is headquartered at 660 First Avenue in Manhattan. Our main location hosts imaging research laboratories alongside an outpatient imaging clinic as well as offices of CAI2R scientists, clinical radiologists, and NYU Langone’s radiology department leadership.

A significant number of our faculty, trainees, and staff are located at NYU Langone’s Translational Science Building at 227 East 30 Street.

Shared infrastructure brings together medical and scientific personnel, creating ideal conditions for translational research.

Our Center generously invests in common resources, such as a radiofrequency (RF) engineering core, high-performance computing clusters, and radiochemistry laboratories.

CAI2R scientists also benefit from access to NYU Langone’s scientific cores, vibrant research environment at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, and connection to New York University’s vast research ecosystem.
Our main location at 660 First Avenue is home to three state-of-the-art human MR scanners and a PET/MR imaging system:

Two Siemens Prisma 3-Tesla (3T) MR scanners
Siemens 7T whole-body MR scanner
Siemens Biograph mMR combined PET/MR scanner
Our researchers also have access to a Siemens Skyra 3T MR scanner and a Siemens Aera 1.5T MR scanner at NYU Langone Orthopedic Center. Opens in a new tab.

Additional resources include an intraoperative MR scanner at Kimmel Pavilion. Opens in a new tab, various MR, PET, and CT scanners at Perlmutter Cancer Center. Opens in a new tab, and many other outpatient and inpatient scanners. Opens in a new tab throughout the NYU Langone network.

An ultra-low-field Hyperfine Swoop 0.064T portable scanner is also at the disposal of our researchers.
